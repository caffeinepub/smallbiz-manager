      "featureTitle": "Convert all currency displays throughout the application from US Dollars ($) to Indian Rupees (₹). Update the currency formatting utility in frontend/src/lib/utils.ts so that the formatCurrency (or equivalent) function uses the 'en-IN' locale and 'INR' currency code, rendering the ₹ symbol instead of $. Ensure this change propagates to all pages and components that display monetary values: Dashboard metrics (total revenue, monthly revenue summary), Invoices (line item prices, totals, invoice summary), Expenses (amounts, category summaries), Inventory/Products (unit prices), Reports (revenue charts, expense vs revenue breakdown, top products).",
