  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/lib/utils.ts to update the formatCurrency function to use 'en-IN' locale and 'INR' currency code, which satisfies the core utility change in REQ-10. The file summaries confirm that pages/components (Dashboard, Invoices, Reports, Expenses, Inventory) use this shared utility. The propagation relies on the utility being a shared function already consumed by all relevant components.",
